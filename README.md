:hammer_and_pick: &nbsp; Some open-source tools for subsurface scientists:

- [`welly`](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/welly) &mdash; tools for handling well data, including logs and deviation surveys.
- [`striplog`](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/striplog) &mdash; a data type for subsurface intervals, e.g. striplogs or stratigraphic columns.
- [`bruges`](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/bruges) &mdash; a Bag of Really Useful Geophysical Equations and Stuff.
- [`redflag`](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/redflag) &mdash; early stages of an early warning system for machine learning projects.

### Hi, I'm a scientific programmer at [Equinor](https://github.com/equinor) in Bergen, Norway

💡 I'm most interested in open source data analysis, visualization, machine learning, data assimilation, signal processing, and open tools for learning, knowledge sharing, and community building. 

🌍 In terms of domain, I'm especially interested in geoscience, especially applied geology and seismic geophysics, having spent most of my career in the energy industry, especially petroleum and geothermal energy. I have a PhD in sedimentology.

💥 For my blog and latest non-work-related projects, including [`redflag`](https://scienxlab.org/redflag), head over to [Scienxlab](https://scienxlab.org/)

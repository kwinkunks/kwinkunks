### 👋 I'm a scientific programmer at [Equinor](https://github.com/equinor) in Bergen, Norway.

💡 I'm most interested in open source data analysis, visualization, machine learning, data assimilation, signal processing, and open tools for learning, knowledge sharing, and community building.

🌍 In terms of domain, I'm especially interested in geoscience, especially applied geology and seismic geophysics, having spent most of my career in the energy industry, especially petroleum and geothermal energy.

:hammer_and_pick: &nbsp; Some open-source tools for subsurface scientists:

- [`welly`](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/welly) &mdash; tools for handling well data, including logs and deviation surveys.
- [`striplog`](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/striplog) &mdash; a data type for subsurface intervals, e.g. striplogs or stratigraphic columns.
- [`bruges`](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/bruges) &mdash; a Bag of Really Useful Geophysical Equations and Stuff.
- [`redflag`](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/redflag) &mdash; early stages of an early warning system for machine learning projects.
